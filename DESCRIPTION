Description: Implements common benchmark probabilistic solar forecast methods for 
	intra-hour (very short-term) and intra-day (short-term) forecasting. Benchmark methods are 
	intended as baselines against which forecast improvements are assessed. Five benchmark 
	classes are available: climatology, complete history persistence ensembles, persistence 
	ensembles, numerical weather prediction ensembles, and Gaussian error distributions. 
	Open-source SURFRAD (irradiance observations) and CAMS McClear (clear-sky irradiance estimates) 
	data are packaged for easy comparison across the 7 SURFRAD locations in the U.S.
