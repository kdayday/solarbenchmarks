This folder should be populated with .nc files by running both grib_to_nc.bat 
and grib_ctrl_to_nc.bat in batches (see lines 17 and 18 in both files), if
the GRIB files have been downloaded from MARS into the "GRIB files/" and 
"GRIB control files/" folders using the request .bat scripts available in 
those 2 folders.
